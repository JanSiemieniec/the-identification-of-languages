# the-identification-of-languages
It is one layer of perceptrons which allows us to identification in which language we have pasted some text. Each perceptron learn from folder /Language, there are folders for each language and in every sub-folders there are some text it that language. All perceptrons based only on frequency of each latter from ASCII (a to z). Every language has its own unique frequency distribution, which allows us to recognise the language.
